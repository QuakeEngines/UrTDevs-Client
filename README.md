UrtDevs_client
===========

UrtDevs client v4.0 (ioquake3 svn 2306)

* UrtDevs client is a customized version of ioquake3 for Urban Terror 4.x
  by Frozen Sand. It includes enhancements that may or may not cause people to ragecry
   

* More specifically, UrtDevs client is bleeding edge ioquake3 with networking cvar overides and dmaHD.
  Also, there are additional tweaks that improve performance and hit-reg and overall performance

  
* Added cvars:
  - ```com_nosplash [0|1]```     -- enable/disable splash screen on client start (set this in your autoexec.cfg)
  - New Networking settings for better performance and more hits:
   * ```*net_maxpackets [30-125]``` (default 62) relates directly to frame rate if you get framerates BELOW, this value adjust it accordingly else if you get a consistent 90/125FPS you may increase it.
   * ```*net_packetdup [0-3]``` (default 1) setting it to 0 has been reported to improve things, but only if you have a PERFECT CONNECTION AND pingless then 50MS
   * ```*net_rate [25000-125000]``` (Bits persecond) (default 125000) This has no effect on bandwith usage, bandwith usage IS directly related to net_maxpackets and net_packetdup 

   
* What you can expect to hear / not hear:
  dmaHD greatly enhances sound quality and precision, and also adds
  doppler effect to moving entities and projectiles. It is similar to ikalizer,

*addional notes
makefile currectly defaults to ```-O2 -mmx -msse -msse2 -msse3``` if you'r pc is old and suck remove the *msse* and recompile
* respect!
  - Pugbot and the community

  - dmaHD: p5ych0runn3r of apd
